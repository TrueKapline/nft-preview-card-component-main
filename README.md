## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GitHub Pages

### What I learned

This challenge was much more interesting than previous one with QR code.

Interactive elements and more complex position of elements had made this challenge a bit harder. This was a good practice.

### Useful resources

- [Cubic Bezier](https://cubic-bezier.com/) - Awesome site that helped me to add beautiful animations with Bezier curves.
